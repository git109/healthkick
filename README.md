# HealthKick

Diabetes reminder application for Windows desktop and Chrome web browser (so far)

Displays a sticker on your desktop every few hours reminding you to measure your
blood glucose levels. The sticker will disappear once a blood glucose reading is taken using the
Bayer Contour USB blood glucose monitor.
